# Test Taker's TI Trove
A collection of programs written for my students owning TI-84+ calculators. Check with me in class or [through email](mailto:ryan.villena@kaplan.com) if your calculator's compatible.

## General
On the SAT and ACT, there are some math problems which require more than a few seconds to solve. It is helpful on the _Calculator Permitted_ sections to outsource the "mechanical" work to a permitted calculator. When programmed correctly, the TI-84+ can save time on problems like [Systems of 2 Variables](https://github.com/RyanVillenaUCR/Test-Takers-TI-Trove/blob/bd715c6a50c9ac2ef77864290646df640d59d3cc/tests.txt#L43) and [Quadratic Roots](https://github.com/RyanVillenaUCR/Test-Takers-TI-Trove/blob/bd715c6a50c9ac2ef77864290646df640d59d3cc/tests.txt#L105), which can be the difference on the final SAT/ACT score.

Each program exists here as a `.8xp` file ([example](https://github.com/RyanVillenaUCR/Test-Takers-TI-Trove/blob/master/8xp/LINSYS3.8xp)) and as a `.txt` file ([example](https://github.com/RyanVillenaUCR/Test-Takers-TI-Trove/blob/master/src/LINSYS3.txt)). Computers/calculators read `.8xp` files, while humans read `.txt` files. You will install the `.8xp` files onto your calculator; I only provide the `.txt` files so you can actually read the code from your computer.

To install onto your calculator, you'll install [TI Connect](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw) onto your computer. You'll use TI Connect and a [USB A-Male to Mini-B cord](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-2-0-Cable-Male/dp/B00NH11N5A) to copy the `.8xp` files to your calculator. More details below.

### Disclaimer
I should note that the use of these programs is **strictly unfair** to those without programmable calculators. Given the decision, I myself would prohibit the use of programmable calculators on these tests.

This said, my goal is to help my students succeed on their tests, and (un)fortunately, programmable calculators are **allowed** on these tests. I provide these programs in the interest of helping my students succeed on their tests _until such a time that programmed calculators are **explicitly** banned from these tests_.

To that last point, it might be surprising that at the time of this writing, the [SAT calculator policy](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/calculator-policy) makes no mention of programs existing on calculators. The [ACT calculator policy](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT-calculator-policy.pdf) prevents requires that calculators lack "documents", but these semantics are ambiguous; one might be able to argue that because programs aren't documents, they are allowed on the ACT.

I thus recommend my students be equipped with these programs, but that they **comply with proctors** who request these programs be deleted on Test Day. These programs simply save time with manual calculations; **students who don't understand the material will not find these resources beneficial.**

* Run the installer

### Transfer to Calculator
* Have a [cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-2-0-Cable-Male/dp/B00NH11N5A) at the ready
* Open ![TI Connect icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71508870-1c884f00-283e-11ea-9b30-1b814cb5249b.png), and click ![Send to TI Device button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71508935-535e6500-283e-11ea-9f27-0058517048ad.png)

* Connect your calculator to the computer using your cable
* Press `Select Device` at the top of this screen:

![Send to TI Device screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71508997-89034e00-283e-11ea-9fb4-6301824b6e0d.png)

* You should see the name of your calculator here, so hit `Select`. If you don't, try hitting `Refresh`.

![Select Device](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71509059-d1227080-283e-11ea-928b-c6f1ff72bb59.png)

* The top of your screen should now look something like this:

* Find the `.8xp` files in that `.zip` file you extracted earlier.

![.8xp files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71509298-b4d30380-283f-11ea-86e0-23140d6c3e3e.png)

* Press `Ctrl+A` to highlight all the `.8xp` files. Then, drag-and-drop to the TI Connect screen.

![Ready to export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71509405-011e4380-2840-11ea-8c15-835267b9f4aa.png)

* Press `Send to Device` at the bottom of the screen. It'll take a minute to transfer.
* If all went well, check your TI to see that the programs went through. Press the `PRGM` button in the center of your TI:

![TI with programs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71509634-de405f00-2840-11ea-9486-56ed80cd504e.png)
