# Test Taker's TI Trove
A collection of programs written for my students owning TI-84+ calculators. Check with me in class or [through email](mailto:ryan.villena@kaplan.com) if your calculator's compatible.

## Editing Programs
### On Desktop
To write/edit programs on a Windows desktop, go to the [TI-Basic Developer downloads page](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/downloads) and download [Program Editor](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/downloads/programeditor.zip). Once this program is installed, simply open your .8xp files (NOT THE .txt FILES) from within TIProgramEditor.

![View of DISTANCE.8xp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71356900-7cc67a80-2538-11ea-9c60-11e764c37018.png)

In here, you are free to edit your programs as if you were programming on a real TI device. Be aware that TIProgramEditor cannot run your TI programs, but it can check your syntax if you hit `Ctrl+E` or click the ![check_syntax icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71356186-4556ce80-2536-11ea-889b-003fa3b52fe1.png) button.

A brief aside if you're new to programming: **TIProgramEditor cannot verify that your program works as intended.** All syntax checking does is test if it's even possible for a real TI to read your program. It's up to you to verify that your program works correctly. See me in class or [email me](mailto:ryan.villena@kaplan.com) if you need some eyes on your programs.

You can send programs to your TI device if it is plugged in via USB; simply ensure that your program's saved, and use the ![send_file icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32404733/71356110-12143f80-2536-11ea-811c-1107e1b4c53c.png) button.
